However, there are other multipurpose rasam recipes and the pepper rasam recipe is one such multipurpose that can also be used as a soup too.<br>I have shared this recipe previously, but I am revisiting it with a new and rustic village-style way of making pepper rasam. The most common way is to make this by dry roasting whole spices with pepper and grounding it to a fine powder. This is later added to the boiling water as seasonings to make a thin runny rasam. However, with the village style fresh herbs like coriander, ginger, and garlic are minced with the spices, particularly pepper. This ensures to make it more flavored and rich with spices. Also, adding herbs with spices makes it healthier and an immunity booster soup meal too. Do try this and I am certain that you would love this recipe.</p><
